## Topic: Cacao tree and the proportion of forest area with a long-term management plan

<p>Cacao tree is grown in <b>monocropping systems,</b> which mean growing just one crop species in a field at a time. This agricultural practice disrupts food systems for wildlife, people, and organisms in the soil. Fortunately, cacao tree can also be grown in <b>agroforestry systems,</b> which mean planting cacao tree in and among diverse trees and crops.</p>

<p> However, in order to move from one system to another system, you need a plan.</b>

The goal is to visualise how the proportion of the forest area with a long-term management plan change over time among the countries that are the world's cacao beans suppliers.


### Data sets
<ul>
<li> The proportion of forest area with a long-term management plan (%) 
<li> Cocoa beans production by each country (tonnes)
</ul>

### Intro idea

<p>The introduction exists to give users a brief insight of the contries we are looking at in this data set. The idea is to have a chocolate bar in the middle of the screen for the users to click on it and break it into pieces. There will be 58 broken pieces of chocolate in total, which represent 58 countries that can grow cacao trees. The size of each piece reflects how much the country contribute to the world's cacao production. To learn more about each country, users can move their mouse over the pieces and the tooltip will show up. </p>

### Idea 1

<p>There are two intractive elements in this idea,</p>
<ul>
<li> The year: 2000, 2010, 2015 and 2022
<li> The list of countries: 58 countries
</ul>
<p>In the left-hand side, there are 100 squares in which each represents 1% and this will make a total of a 100%. Once users select the year and the country they want to observe the proportion of the forest area with a long-term management plan, the squares will change it colours, accordingly.</p>

### Idea 2

<p>This second idea is inspired by a sand timer. The top bulb represents the percentage of the forest area with a long-term management plan and the bottom blub represents the percentage of the country contribution in the worldâ€™s cocao. The pro about this idea is that it visualises 2 data sets at the same time. However, you have to look at it for a while get to the idea.</p>
  
### Idea 3

<p>The last idea is inspired by the dripping of chocolate. There is a graph with the x and y axis upsidedown. The x-axis represents the year and the y-axis represents the percentage of the forest area with a long-term management plan, which starts with 0% from the top down to 100% in the bottom. The longer the drip means more percentage of the forest area with a long-term management plan. With this visualisation, you get to see the trend changes over time. </p>
  
<p>You may notice year gaps between 2000 - 2010 - 2015, which is because the data is missing. </p>

<p>For the interactivity, there is a dropdown user can select the country they want to learn more about and the fun part is that once they chnage the country, the dripping will change it lengths.</p>
