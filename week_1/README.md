## Topic: Cacao tree and the proportion of forest area with a long-term management plan

<p>Cacao tree is grown in <b>monocropping systems,</b> which mean growing just one crop species in a field at a time. This agricultural practice disrupts food systems for wildlife, people, and organisms in the soil. Fortunately, cacao tree can also be grown in <b>agroforestry systems,</b> which mean planting cacao tree in and among diverse trees and crops.</p>

<p> However, in order to move from one system to another system, you need a plan.</b>

The goal is to visualise how the proportion of the forest area with a long-term management plan change over time among the countries that are the world's cacao beans suppliers.


### Data sets
<ul>
<li> The proportion of forest area with a long-term management plan (%) 
<li> Cocoa beans production by each country (tonnes)
</ul>

### Intro idea

<p>The introduction exists to give users a brief insight of the contries we are looking at in this data set. The idea is to have a chocolate bar in the middle of the screen for the users to click on it and break it into pieces. There will be 58 broken pieces of chocolate in total, which represent 58 countries that can grow cacao trees. The size of each piece reflects how much the country contribute to the world's cacao production. To learn more about each country, users can move their mouse over the pieces and the tooltip will show up. </p>
